# Salon CMS

## Introduction
This was a personal project to build from start to finish a custom cms to manage a site. The idea being that general cms's like wordpress are great but because they are designed to to manage this abstract idea of "content" their backends always have a learning curve. This was an experement to see what could be done if instead of a one size fits all cms we built a cms specific for the layout of the site.

## Requirments for the site
* Advertise the salon
* Service price list
* Staff section
* Contact section and information


## Features
* Single user login
* Drag and drop image upload
* Google analytics and basic reporting in dashboard
* Messaging system
* Google maps integration
